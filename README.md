# Alphabet Image Classifier

This repository contains the image letter classifier project for the course "**Optimization Methods for Data Science**" at the Sapienza University of Rome. The project aims to develop a classifier (from scratch) that can accurately identify letters of the alphabet from a set of images. The classifier is implemented using a variety of machine learning methods: *Multilayer perceptron (MLP)*, *Radial basis function (RBF) network*, *Support vector machine (SVM)*.

Professor: *Veronica Piccialli*, *Cecilia Salvatore*, *Giampaolo Liuzzi*
