### Project Description

This repository contains the code for a letter classifier project for the course "Optimization Methods for Data Science" at the Sapienza University of Rome.

The project aims to develop a classifier that can accurately identify letters of the alphabet from a set of images. The classifier is implemented using a variety of optimization methods, including gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and Newton's method. In addition, the project also includes the following machine learning methods:

* Multilayer perceptron (MLP)
* Radial basis function (RBF) network
* Support vector machine (SVM)
* Most Violating Pair (MVP)

The repository contains the following files:

* `data.txt`: A file containing a dataset of images of letters
* `project.ipynb`: A Python notebook that implements the classifier

The authors of this project is:

* Alessandro Potenza

Professors who provided guidance and feedback:

* Veronica Piccialli
* Cecilia Salvatore
* Giampaolo Liuzzi
